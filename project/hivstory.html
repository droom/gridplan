The timeline as given to me is quite complex so I need some considered time to sub it down and make sense of it. On looking at the overall text it feels as if I can get it to between 10-12 'events'. Each event needs a little explaining, so I hope to give you a couple of lines of text to sit next to each event. Bear with me as I am busy at the moment but will try to get it to you as soon as I have sufficient wriggle room.</em>

            <p>The National HIV Story Trust (NHST) films, records and preserves the stories of those affected by the AIDS pandemic of the 1980s and 90s. The NHST hopes the 120+ interviews filmed with survivors and families, partners and medical professionals will be a voice for those who didnâ€™t survive, a chance to honour those who did, and an education for those who live so freely today. The interview footage has been donated to the London Metropolitan Archive for public and research access and as a record in perpetuity. Arrange access to the archive here.</p>
