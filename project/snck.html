            <p>Placemaking is a multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. Placemaking capitalizes on a local community's assets, inspiration, and potential, with the intention of creating public spaces that improve urban vitality and promote people's health, happiness, and well-being.</p>
            <p>Some of the major thinking behind Placemaking gained traction in the 1960s when thinkers like Jane Jacobs and William H. Whyte introduced ideas about designing cities for people and not just for capitalist structures and cars. Their work mainly focuses on the importance of lively neighborhoods; its social and cultural fabric and inviting public spaces. Jacobs in her book (death and life of American cities) encouraged the now-famous idea of "eyes on the street," and encouraged everyday citizens to take ownership of streets.</p>
            <p>Urban design and placemaking. As our cities and urban centres become denser and need to cater for increasingly complex demands, the pressure on the built environment is mounting both in terms of function and quality. 'Getting the place right' requires a strong appreciation of the local context, a good dose of problem solving and creativity and a multidisciplinary expertise in making sense of practical yet crucial contingencies, especially movement and servicing. Increasingly, demonstration of how placemaking and design contribute to wider sustainable development goals is critical. Local and central governments are declaring climate emergencies and setting targets and plans for net zero carbon, while supporting equity, inclusivity, environmental protection and enhancement, alongside economic growth.</p>
            <p>Studio is your friendly design studio known for experimental, but approachable and functional design. Clients come to us because they wanted to talk to the actual designer, not the middleman. Or they wanted an agency that was polished but not predictable. Or they're actually full capable, but need some help getting systems and templates in place so they can go off and do the damn thing. Or they wanted someone that would talk business strategy (not just design) and help them actually grow their business aka make a profit (not just look pretty). At the end of the day, we want to make the thing that's in your head look better and grow bigger than you thought it could. The best way to start is to fill out our form so we can do what we do best - go go go! Monument is an architecture studio in Birmingham, AL working to build more than just buildings. Contact us today to get started on your next project.</p>
            <p>Spaceagency, together with Weston Williamson + Partners, was appointed in 2018 by Network Rail to rethink and redesign the Wayfinding and Signage guidance for Network Rail’s Managed Stations in the UK. We now work with forward-thinking developers to create great places to live, work and visit. </p>

            <p>Our aim is to collaborate with town centre planners and developers to create incredible identities for amazing places. The past decade has seen huge changes take place in our towns and on our high streets. The way that we live, work, shop and socialise has changed beyond recognition which has created immense challenges for town planners and those involved in developing the built environment. Internet shopping, declining footfall and increasing costs have had a huge impact on the viability of the retail sector. Vast shopping centres occupying prime town centre spaces, generally have increasing numbers of empty units and are often in need of reinvention. The revitalisation and reinvigoration of our towns invariably require a new ‘destination focussed ‘ approach to marketing and branding.</p>
            <p>Spaceagency is an interdisciplinary design studio. We believe in the importance of how spaces and building interact with, and ‘talk’, to people. We do this by analysing how buildings and spaces from a ‘user-centric perspective to identify touchpoints and to choreograph people’s interaction with and journey through a space to make it intuitive, memorable and enjoyable. We work at the intersection of architecture, branding and environmental design to help our clients create a holistic, seamless and integrated experience that unites architecture, their brand ethos and local heritage into one coherent and authentic experience. We always look at the ‘user first’ and see our work as the ‘user interface’ for the built environment. Led by the founding partners, Sarah Manning and Peter Feldmann, Spaceagency’s work is defined by their joint expertise; merging architecture and urban design with wayfinding and graphic communication. MARK London helps build (or re-build) much-loved destinations and neighbourhoods.</p>

            <li>‘Bringing the inside out’ The route to being locally loved, is tapping into talent that already exists within communities; entrepreneurial, creative or tech. We find the hidden gems.</li>
